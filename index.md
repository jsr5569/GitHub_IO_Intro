## Welcome to my Homepage

This is a homework assignment for my [Software Engineering Freshman Seminar](http://www.se.rit.edu/~swen-101/00/index.html).

### A Little Bit About Me

My name is Jarred Reepmeyer, I am 18 years old, and I was born and raised in Albany, New York.
My family consists of me, my 12 year old sister Kaiya, my Mom, and my Stepfather. As for my education, I graduated from Shaker
High School in 2020. Throughout all of high school I always had a special love for my math, science, and technology classes. This 
eventually lead me to where I am today; pursuing a Software Engineering degree at Rochester Institute of Technology. Finally, there
are a multitude of things I love to do whenever I have some of the ever elusive "free time". 
These things include: reading, playing videogames, hanging out with friends or family, and just about anything that involves the outdoors(Ex: Fishing, Biking, etc.).
Now that you know a little more about me as a whole I will leave you will one last trivial fact about me...

My Favorite Food is Meatloaf!
